EncryptSyncGUI

GUI for encryptSync

Should use the core package from encryptSync to make a JAVAFX GUI that can automatically sync the unencrypted directory to the encrypted one. Currently at version 0.5 as it can login in profiles and encrypt decrypt files but minimising to the tray and automated encryption decryption as well as configuration are not yet implemented. Also ugly as hell.
